## I was wrong, it transpired.
The javascript-heavy DOACC project documentation _does_ function when hosted on Github pages.

I was always a bit uncomfortable with Minkiz’ hosting the DOACC documentation, I felt the self-signed CA cert was an unfortunate barrier so I am quite pleased to announce the release of the DOACC documentation repository and web site.

The new web site is powered by Github’s “pages” feature and is thus entirely open source and available for direct community contribution.  

We welcome pull requests!
